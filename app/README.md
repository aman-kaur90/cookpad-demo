Using MVVM  client application architecture which separate view logic from business logic

Why MVVM :
Many to many mapping
viewmodel is lifecycle aware
viewmodel does'nt hold refrence to view

Used Coroutines : as they are light weight threads for asynchronous programming,
and used retrofit for Network calls

//Focus Area :
Mainly focused on Architecture of an App

Scope of improvements :
Due to time constraint wont be able to include all things
    Points :-
        1. test cases can be written in more efficient way for all used viewmodels and logic included
        2. In design, animations, coordinate layout , playing with theme
        3. Functional Concept :rating, favourites , search, download..this can also be included
        
        Note : include one image too related to followed architecture
